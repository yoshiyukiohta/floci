## Hot-Reloading via Reactive S3 Sync

Floci supports an automatic hot-reloading mechanism when functions are deployed via S3. This follows the standard AWS behavior where S3 and Lambda interact, but is optimized for a seamless local development experience.

When a Lambda function is created using an S3 bucket and key, Floci maintains a link between the function and its source object. Any subsequent update to that S3 object (e.g., via `s3:PutObject`) automatically triggers a reactive synchronization:

1.  **Detection**: Floci detects the S3 update via an internal event system.
2.  **Synchronization**: The new code is automatically re-extracted to the local code storage.
3.  **Invalidation**: Any active "warm" containers for that function are proactively drained.
4.  **Reload**: The very next invocation starts a fresh container with the updated code.

This allows you to update your Lambda code by simply re-uploading your ZIP to S3, without having to manually call `UpdateFunctionCode` or restart any containers.

### Example

```bash
# 1. Create a function linked to S3
aws lambda create-function \
  --function-name my-function \
  --code S3Bucket=my-bucket,S3Key=function.zip \
  ...

# 2. Invoke (starts a warm container)
aws lambda invoke --function-name my-function out.json

# 3. Update the code in S3 (Triggers Reactive Sync)
aws s3 cp updated-function.zip s3://my-bucket/function.zip

# 4. Invoke again (automatically picks up the new code)
aws lambda invoke --function-name my-function out.json
```

!!! note "Standard Behavior"
    This mechanism requires no custom configuration or non-standard magic strings. It works with standard AWS SDKs and CLI tools, providing a "live" development feel while staying within the AWS API contract.

## Hot-Reload via Bind Mount

For the tightest inner-loop development cycle, Floci supports a **bind-mount hot-reload** mode. Instead of packaging code into a ZIP and uploading it to S3, you point Floci directly at a directory on your host machine. The directory is bind-mounted into `/var/task` inside the container, so every invocation runs the files as they currently exist on disk — no upload, no redeploy.

This is enabled by using the magic bucket name `hot-reload` when creating a function:

```bash
aws lambda create-function \
  --function-name my-function \
  --runtime nodejs22.x \
  --role arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/lambda-role \
  --handler index.handler \
  --code S3Bucket=hot-reload,S3Key=/absolute/path/to/your/code \
  --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566
```

The `S3Key` must be an **absolute path** reachable by the Docker daemon. When Floci runs in Docker Compose, this is the path on the Docker host (the machine running Docker), not the path inside the Floci container.

### How it works

1. `CreateFunction` with `S3Bucket=hot-reload` marks the function as a hot-reload function; `S3Key` is stored as the host-side path.
2. On each invocation, Floci starts a **fresh ephemeral container** with the host path bind-mounted at `/var/task`.
3. The container executes the files as they exist at invocation time — editing a file and immediately invoking picks up the change without any API call.
4. After the invocation completes the container is stopped and removed, ensuring the next invocation always sees the current state of the directory.

### Configuration

Hot-reload must be enabled explicitly. By default it is disabled so that `S3Bucket=hot-reload` is treated as a regular S3 bucket name.

```bash
FLOCI_SERVICES_LAMBDA_HOT_RELOAD_ENABLED=true

# Optional: restrict which host paths may be bind-mounted (comma-separated)
FLOCI_SERVICES_LAMBDA_HOT_RELOAD_ALLOWED_PATHS=/home/user/projects,/tmp
```

**Docker Compose setup** — enable the feature and share the Docker socket:

```yaml
services:
  floci:
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      FLOCI_SERVICES_LAMBDA_HOT_RELOAD_ENABLED: "true"
```

### Limitations

- The `S3Key` path is interpreted by the **Docker daemon**, not by Floci. When Floci itself runs inside Docker, the path must exist on the Docker host machine, not inside the Floci container.
- Hot-reload containers are always ephemeral — there is no warm-container reuse. Each invocation pays a cold-start penalty.
- `UpdateFunctionCode` on a hot-reload function converts it back to a standard Zip function (the hot-reload bind-mount is removed).
- S3 reactive sync is skipped for hot-reload functions — edits are picked up directly from disk.

### Difference from Reactive S3 Sync

| | Reactive S3 Sync | Bind-Mount Hot-Reload |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | Upload a new ZIP to S3 | Edit files on disk |
| Cold start | Only after upload | Every invocation |
| Requires upload step | Yes | No |
| Works without `hot-reload` enabled | Yes | No |
| Path on host required | No | Yes |

!!! note "Concurrency enforcement"
    Reserved concurrency is enforced: invocations beyond the reserved value
    return `TooManyRequestsException` (HTTP 429). Functions without a reserved
    value share a **per-region** pool — AWS Lambda's "account-level" limit is
    in fact a per-account-per-region quota, and Floci mirrors that by
    partitioning counters on the ARN's region segment. The pool size (default
    1000) is configurable via `floci.services.lambda.region-concurrency-limit`
    and applies independently to each region. `PutFunctionConcurrency`
    validates that the requested value leaves at least
    `floci.services.lambda.unreserved-concurrency-min` (default 100) available
    for unreserved functions in that region. `PutProvisionedConcurrencyConfig`
    and related provisioned-concurrency operations remain unimplemented.

    Reducing or clearing a function's reserved value does not kill
    invocations that are already in flight — this matches AWS, which
    applies changes only to new invocations. As a consequence, during the
    drain window `Σreserved-inflight + unreserved-inflight` can briefly
    exceed `region-concurrency-limit`.

Function URLs are also reachable directly on `/{proxy:.*}` under the Lambda URL controller, which routes the request into the normal `Invoke` path.

**Stubbed:** `ListLayers` and `ListLayerVersions` return empty arrays. No layer storage exists.

## Not Implemented

These AWS Lambda operations have no handler in Floci. Calls will return `404` or an error:

- Layers (`PublishLayerVersion`, `DeleteLayerVersion`, `GetLayerVersion`, `GetLayerVersionByArn`, `AddLayerVersionPermission`, `RemoveLayerVersionPermission`, `GetLayerVersionPolicy`)
- Provisioned concurrency (`PutProvisionedConcurrencyConfig`, `GetProvisionedConcurrencyConfig`, `ListProvisionedConcurrencyConfigs`, `DeleteProvisionedConcurrencyConfig`)
- Dead-letter, async invoke config, and event invoke config operations
- `InvokeWithResponseStream`
- Code signing management (only `GetFunctionCodeSigningConfig` is wired; there is no `PutFunctionCodeSigningConfig` or `CreateCodeSigningConfig`)
- Account and regional settings (`GetAccountSettings`)

### Docker socket requirement

Lambda requires the Docker socket. Mount it in your compose file:

```yaml
services:
  floci:
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

### S3 virtual-hosted-style addressing inside Lambda containers

AWS SDKs use **virtual-hosted-style** S3 addressing by default, forming URLs like
`https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/key`. Against Floci the same pattern becomes
`http://my-bucket.localhost.floci.io:4566/key`.

When Floci runs **inside Docker**, Lambda containers are on the same Docker
network. Docker's embedded DNS resolves the exact alias `localhost.floci.io`
correctly, but has no wildcard support — `my-bucket.localhost.floci.io`
falls through to public DNS and resolves to the wrong IP, causing the Lambda
invocation to time out.

**Floci solves this automatically** by running an embedded DNS server (UDP/53)
on its container IP. All Lambda containers launched by Floci are configured to
use it as their DNS resolver. The embedded DNS server:

- Resolves `*.localhost.floci.io` → Floci's Docker network IP
- Forwards all other queries to the upstream resolver from `/etc/resolv.conf`

No extra configuration or `cap_add` is needed — Docker containers have
`CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` in their default capability set, so Floci (running as a
non-root user) can bind UDP/53 without any changes to your Compose file.

!!! tip "Docker Compose service names"
    If Floci runs as a Docker Compose service and you attach Lambda containers
    to that Compose network, set `FLOCI_HOSTNAME` to the service name, for
    example `FLOCI_HOSTNAME=floci`. Floci then injects
    `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://floci:4566` into Lambda containers and returns
    SQS `QueueUrl` values with the same reachable host.

    This avoids function-side rewrites from `localhost` or `localhost.floci.io`
    to `floci`, and keeps normal AWS SDK clients pointed at the Docker DNS name
    that the Lambda container can resolve.

!!! note "Path-style as a workaround"
    If you cannot use virtual-hosted-style (e.g. Floci is running natively on
    the host, not in Docker), configure the SDK client with
    `forcePathStyle: true` / `s3ForcePathStyle: true`. Requests will go to
    `http://localhost:4566/my-bucket/key` instead and work without DNS.

#### Migrating from LocalStack

If your Lambda functions have `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566`
hardcoded, add the LocalStack suffix to Floci's DNS resolver so it resolves to
Floci's IP without any function-side changes:

Via environment variable — use a comma-separated list for multiple suffixes:

```bash
# Single suffix
FLOCI_DNS_EXTRA_SUFFIXES=localhost.localstack.cloud

# Multiple suffixes
FLOCI_DNS_EXTRA_SUFFIXES=localhost.localstack.cloud,localhost.example.internal
```

### Real AWS Credentials

By default, Floci injects placeholder credentials (`test`/`test`/`test`) into Lambda containers. This is sufficient when all SDK calls target Floci's emulated services.

For hybrid local/cloud testing — where some services are emulated and others hit real AWS — you can mount your host `~/.aws` directory into Lambda containers:

```yaml
services:
  floci:
    image: floci/floci:latest
    environment:
      FLOCI_SERVICES_LAMBDA_AWS_CONFIG_PATH: /Users/me/.aws
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

When `aws-config-path` is set:

- The host path is bind-mounted **read-only** into each Lambda container at `/opt/aws-config`
- `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` and `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` env vars are set so the SDK discovers credentials regardless of the container's HOME directory
- No `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` env vars are injected

When unset (default), Floci reads credentials from its own environment and falls back to `test`/`test`/`test`.

!!! tip "Routing specific services to real AWS"
    To keep some services on Floci while others hit real AWS, clear the global endpoint and set service-specific overrides in your function's `--environment`:

    ```
    AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=                                          # clear Floci's global endpoint
    AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_SES=http://localhost.floci.io:4566       # SES stays on Floci
    AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_CLOUDWATCHLOGS=http://localhost.floci.io:4566  # CloudWatch stays on Floci
    ```

    The AWS SDK supports `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_<SERVICE>` natively. Services without an override will use real AWS endpoints.

!!! note "Credential passthrough without mounting"
    If you don't need the full `~/.aws` directory (e.g., you only have static credentials), you can pass them to Floci's environment directly. When `aws-config-path` is unset, Floci forwards its own `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` env vars into Lambda containers:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
      AWS_SESSION_TOKEN: ${AWS_SESSION_TOKEN}
    ```

### Private registry authentication

Container image functions (`"PackageType": "Image"`) that pull from private registries need Docker credentials. See [Docker Configuration → Private Registry Authentication](../configuration/docker.md#private-registry-authentication) for the full guide.

## Examples

```bash
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566

# Package a simple Node.js function
cat > index.mjs << 'EOF'
export const handler = async (event) => {
  console.log("Event:", JSON.stringify(event));
  return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }) };
};
EOF
zip function.zip index.mjs

# Deploy the function
aws lambda create-function \
  --function-name my-function \
  --runtime nodejs22.x \
  --role arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/lambda-role \
  --handler index.handler \
  --zip-file fileb://function.zip \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# Invoke synchronously
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name my-function \
  --payload '{"key":"value"}' \
  --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
  response.json \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

cat response.json

# Invoke asynchronously
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name my-function \
  --invocation-type Event \
  --payload '{"key":"value"}' \
  --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
  /dev/null \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL

# Update code
zip function.zip index.mjs
aws lambda update-function-code \
  --function-name my-function \
  --zip-file fileb://function.zip \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```

## Event Source Mappings

Connect Lambda to SQS, Kinesis, or DynamoDB Streams:

```bash
# SQS trigger
QUEUE_ARN=$(aws sqs get-queue-attributes \
  --queue-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL/000000000000/orders \
  --attribute-names QueueArn \
  --query Attributes.QueueArn --output text \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL)

aws lambda create-event-source-mapping \
  --function-name my-function \
  --event-source-arn $QUEUE_ARN \
  --batch-size 10 \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```

### ScalingConfig (SQS only)

`CreateEventSourceMapping` and `UpdateEventSourceMapping` accept a
`ScalingConfig.MaximumConcurrency` integer between 2 and 1000 on SQS
event sources, matching the AWS wire format. `GetEventSourceMapping` and
`ListEventSourceMappings` echo the value back when set; responses omit
the `ScalingConfig` field entirely when no cap is configured.

```bash
aws lambda create-event-source-mapping \
  --function-name my-function \
  --event-source-arn $QUEUE_ARN \
  --scaling-config MaximumConcurrency=5 \
  --endpoint-url $AWS_ENDPOINT_URL
```

Validation mirrors AWS: values outside 2–1000 are rejected with
`InvalidParameterValueException`, and `ScalingConfig` on a non-SQS event
source (Kinesis / DynamoDB Streams) is also rejected — those services
use `ParallelizationFactor` instead, which is a separate field.

!!! note "Enforcement status"
    The configured `MaximumConcurrency` is persisted and returned on the
    wire, but the SQS poller does not yet cap concurrent invocations at
    this value (the poller today serializes invocations per ESM to one
    at a time regardless). Real parallel dispatch capped by
    `MaximumConcurrency` is tracked as a follow-up.

## Supported Runtimes

Any runtime that has an official AWS Lambda container image works with Floci (e.g. `nodejs22.x`, `python3.13`, `java21`, `go1.x`, `provided.al2023`).
